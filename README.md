## 🚀 About

Logic Simulator is a **real-time logic circuit simulator** where you can:

- Create inputs (switches)  
- Connect them to gates like **AND, OR, NOT, XOR**  
- See the outputs **instantly**  

This project is **purely educational and for fun**. It’s not intended for professional or industrial use, but it’s a great way to understand digital logic interactively.

## 🎨 Features

- ✅ Create multiple inputs and outputs  
- ✅ Add standard logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR)  
- ✅ Real-time output visualization  
- ✅ Drag-and-drop interface (if applicable)  
- ✅ Fully client-side, no backend required
